Hello, team.

It was a seemingly simple task and it was not clear why it took so long. As it
turned out later, it is not so easy to create an algorithm that does not crash
and works with html code of any size, especially when you take into account all
the possible variants while using valid html code.

I used parsing and tagging to break the code into small pieces that would be
easy to work with.

I used a stack that makes it easy and convenient to keep track of the tag
hierarchy and create a proper architecture of my JSON file.

I created a function that builds my JSON using small elements that make my
structure understandable while handling different cases.

Throughout the assignment I used the following resources: chatGPT, Regulex,
Stack overflow and various google articles to delve deeper into the topic I was
working with.
